# University Student Timetable App - Brainstorming Session Results

## Executive Summary

**Session Topic:** University student timetable app for class scheduling and notifications
**Duration:** ~20 minutes
**Technique Used:** User Journey Mapping
**Total Ideas Generated:** 15+ feature concepts and user experience insights
**Key Theme:** Simplicity and focus on core functionality

## User Journey Mapping Technique

**Technique Description:** Explored the complete student experience from app discovery through daily usage, focusing on pain points and opportunities.

**Core User Story - "Alex's Journey":**
- University student seeking better class organization
- Downloads app attracted by impressive UI
- Needs simple timetable input and reliable notifications
- Daily campus navigation between different classroom locations (CT-401, CT-407, etc.)

**Key Ideas Generated:**

### Timetable Input Methods
- Photo capture of printed/digital timetables
- Manual entry option for flexibility
- Extract key information: class name, time, room number, instructor

### Notification System
- Single notification per class: "Class starting in X minutes"
- Format: "Class Name - Room Number - Start Time"
- Example: "Object Oriented Programming Lab - CT-407 - starts at 08:00"
- User-controlled timing (e.g., 15 minutes before)
- No follow-up if notification is missed

### User Experience Insights
- Impressive UI creates strong first impression
- Flexibility in data entry methods accommodates different student preferences
- Clean, focused notifications without overwhelming features
- Respect for user autonomy (no nagging for missed notifications)

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities - Ready to Implement
1. **Core Timetable Entry**
   - Photo upload functionality
   - Manual entry form
   - Basic data extraction (subject, time, location)

2. **Simple Notification System**
   - Pre-class alerts with essential information
   - User-customizable timing
   - Clean notification format

3. **Minimal UI Design**
   - Focus on impressive, clean interface
   - Streamlined user flow
   - Essential information display

### Future Innovations - Potential Enhancements
1. **Smart Photo Processing**
   - OCR for automatic timetable data extraction
   - Recognition of common university timetable formats
   - Validation and error correction

2. **Campus Integration**
   - Room location mapping
   - Building-specific notification timing
   - University system integration

### Insights & Learnings

**Key Realizations:**
- Students value simplicity over feature complexity
- Real university timetables are complex (multiple instructors, room codes, varying durations)
- One well-timed notification is better than multiple alerts
- Missed notifications should not trigger additional app behavior
- Visual appeal is important for initial user engagement

**Design Philosophy Discovered:**
- "Do one thing exceptionally well" approach
- Respect user preferences and habits
- No unnecessary friction or follow-ups
- Focus on practical campus life scenarios

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Features

1. **Timetable Input System**
   - Rationale: Core functionality that enables all other features
   - Next steps: Design photo capture + manual entry workflows
   - Resources needed: OCR library research, UI/UX design
   - Timeline: Foundation for entire app

2. **Smart Notifications**
   - Rationale: Primary value proposition for users
   - Next steps: Define notification format and timing logic
   - Resources needed: Push notification system implementation
   - Timeline: Critical for MVP

3. **Clean User Interface**
   - Rationale: Important for user adoption and retention
   - Next steps: Create visual design system and user flows
   - Resources needed: UI/UX design expertise
   - Timeline: Parallel to feature development

## Reflection & Follow-up

**What Worked Well:**
- User journey mapping revealed practical daily scenarios
- Real timetable example provided concrete context
- Focus on simplicity prevented feature creep
- Interactive dialogue uncovered user preferences

**Areas for Further Exploration:**
- Technical implementation of photo processing
- University-specific timetable format variations
- Cross-platform notification reliability
- User onboarding and setup experience

**Recommended Follow-up Techniques:**
- Technical feasibility analysis
- Competitive analysis of existing scheduling apps
- User persona development for different student types
- Prototyping and user testing sessions

**Questions for Future Sessions:**
- How might the app handle semester/term transitions?
- What accessibility features should be considered?
- How can the app work offline?
- What analytics would be useful for improving the experience?
